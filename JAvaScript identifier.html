    <h2>Java Script Identifier</h2>
    <p>All JavaScript varable must be identified with unique names. <br> These unique name are called identifiers <br> Identifiers can be shorts name (like x and Y) or more discriptive names (age,sum,total volume)  <br> The geneal rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
        <ul style="color:red">
     -Name can contain letters digits underscore and dollar  signs. <br> -Name must begain with a letter. <br> -Names can also begain with $ and _(but will be not use in it in this tutorial).
     <br> -Name are case sensitive (Y and y are different variables ).
     <br> -Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords)can not be use as names. 
        </ul>
        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. </p>
        <p><b>The Assignment operator</b>
        <br>In JavaScript, the qual sign (=) is an "assigment" operator, not an "equal to " operator.
    <br>This  is different from algebra. The flowing does not make sense in algebra: </p>
    <p style="color:blue;"> x = x + 5 </p>
    <p>In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

        (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)</p>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.</p>

        <h1>JavaScriptData types.</h1>
<p >
   <ol style="color: brown;"> -just variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe". <br>

    -In programming, text values are called text strings. <br>
    
    -JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings. <br>
    
    -Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. <br>
    
    -If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.</ol>
</p>
     </p>
     <h3>example: JavScript Variables</h3>
     <p>string are written with quotes.</p>
     <p>number are written without quotes.</p>
     <p id="demo"></p>
     <script>
        const pi =3.24;
        let person =" prakash Limbu";
        let answer = " Yes Iam!";
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = pi + "<br>" + person + "<br>" + answer;
     </script>
